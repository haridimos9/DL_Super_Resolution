# DL_Super_Resolution

This repository contains 3 experiments used by our team for the task of Super Resolution on [Veo's](https://www.veo.co/da) footbal matches.
* ESRGAN (Enhanced SRGAN) Single Image Super Resolution) 
* SRGAN 3 (Multi Image Super Resolution)
* iSeeBetter (Video Super Resolution)

In each folder there is the code for each experiment we conducted.
Additionally, here lies the [explainer notebook](https://github.com/haridimos9/DL_Super_Resolution/blob/main/reproduce.ipynb) where you can test the results on one (or more) images.

Additionally, you can have a sneak peak of the results from the demo gif, where we compare an original clip, with the one created from the ESRGAN model, one created from iSeeBetter with MSE loss, and one with the paper's APIT loss:
