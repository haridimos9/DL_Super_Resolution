# DL_Super_Resolution

This repository contains 3 experiments used by our team for the task of Super Resolution on [Veo's](https://www.veo.co/da) footbal matches.
* ESRGAN (Enhanced SRGAN) Single Image Super Resolution) 
* SRGAN 3 (Multi Image Super Resolution)
* iSeeBetter (Video Super Resolution)

In each folder there is the code for each experiment we conducted.
Additionally, here lies the [explainer notebook](https://github.com/haridimos9/DL_Super_Resolution/blob/main/reproduce.ipynb) where you can test the results on one (or more) images.
