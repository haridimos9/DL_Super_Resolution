### This is the ESRGAN model. The original repo is here : https://github.com/eriklindernoren/PyTorch-GAN#enhanced-super-resolution-gan

* Inside the implementations/esrgan folder are the python files needed for the training and testing of the model
    * The esrgan.py file is used for the training of the model
    * The test*.py files are slightly different versions of the same file, and are used for inference, using the generator we created.
* In the data/demo folder, there are the result frames from the below clip we used for demonstration.
